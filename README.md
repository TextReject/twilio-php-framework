twilio-php-framework
====================

A basic framework for a php application to use Twilio.

#About

This framework was built by [Andrew Hess](https://github.com/andhess) and [Philip Thomas](https://github.com/philipithomas) for [Text Reject](http://www.textreject.com).

The code provides a basic foundation to quickly get started with a php application that connects with Twilio.

#Notes
*Be sure to set Twilio to connect with call.php and sms.php for calls and texts, respectively.
*Our application runs on Heroku, the dbOpen() function provided uses credentials from a config file.
